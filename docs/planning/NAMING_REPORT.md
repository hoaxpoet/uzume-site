# Naming Report — Phosphene Rename Sprint

*2026-08-09 · Prepared for the website/launch planning effort*

## FINAL DECISION (2026-08-09): The name is Uzume

**Uzume** (ウズメ, from **Ame-no-Uzume**, the kami whose drummed, danced performance lured Amaterasu — the sun — out of the heavenly rock-cave and returned light to a darkened world; mythic founder of *kagura*, patroness of performers, dawn, mirth, and revelry). Pronunciation: **oo-ZOO-meh**, three open syllables.

Why it won, after five rounds: the Ama-no-Iwato myth is the product stated as folklore — the world goes dark, **Omoikane plans the session in advance** (down to hanging the mirror before there is any light to catch), **Uzume performs**, and light comes out to watch. Planner → performer → display is the app's architecture (pre-analysis/orchestrator → render engine → screen). It also satisfies the phonetic spec Matt converged on across rounds (short, singsong, open vowels, liquid, vowel-ended, unmisspellable after one hearing) — and it names the *performer*, where Hotarugari named the *audience*.

Confirmation-pass results (2026-08-09):

- **Domains:** `uzume.app` — no WHOIS record; available (final confirmation is the registrar search at checkout). `uzume.io` — available, registry-grade RDAP. `uzume.com` — held since 1998 by **Uzume Taiko** (active Canadian taiko ensemble); registration expires 2026-08-27 and will most likely renew — put a watch/backorder on it, plan on uzume.app as canonical. `uzume.co` — dead site (defunct task app).
- **Trademarks (US):** only live filings are by a Durham, NC financial-planning firm ("UZUME COLLECTIVE", financial services; "MONEY CRONE", education) — no UZUME mark in any software, entertainment, or music class. UK's UZUME LTD dissolved 2026-06.
- **Known neighbors, ranked:** (1) **Uzume Taiko** — active music-performance org sharing the name for the same mythic reason; distant category (live taiko vs. macOS software), regional, neither party owns the goddess. (2) A **dormant iPhone task app "Uzume"** (last update 2022, no ratings, dead website) — relevant only if Mac App Store distribution ever happens (list as "Uzume — Music Visualizer"); direct-download distribution unaffected. (3) **EVL, UIC, 1999**: an interactive immersive art installation named Uzume at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory — a precedent, not a conflict: visualization artists reached for this goddess 27 years ago. (4) Minor: a Neptunia game character, a Discord bot, near-inactive GitHub user `uzume` (repo path `hoaxpoet/uzume` unaffected).
- **Sensitivity:** Ame-no-Uzume is an actively venerated kami; risk is low because the app sits inside her exact domain (performance) — homage, not extraction — with ample precedent (Amaterasu in *Ōkami*, etc.). Keep marketing on the "performed the light back" framing; show the pronunciation once on the site.
- **Registration plan:** `uzume.app` (canonical) + `uzume.io` at Cloudflare Registrar in one sitting; watch/backorder on `uzume.com`.

**Brand system settled alongside the name:** the in-app onboarding/help persona is **Pythagoras** (the first person to claim the sky was a music show — the man who heard what no one else could, now explaining what you're seeing). The AI orchestrator's internal codename is **Omoikane** (the kami who planned the light-restoring performance). Coleridge's 1795 line — *"a light in sound, a sound-like power in light"* — is the tagline (public domain). Full myth research in MYTH_RESEARCH.md.

**Path here, for the record:** round 1 vetted Latin vocabulary (Isophote/Clavilux finalists); round 2, Latin coinages (Sonolumen, Cantilux — none stuck); round 3, folk/firefly territory — **Hotarugari** was provisionally decided (cleanest domain sheet of the entire sprint: .com/.app/.io all free, zero collisions; its cost was five syllables and it names the viewing ritual rather than the performer). Round 4, the myth sweep (sound↔light interlocks across nine traditions), surfaced Uzume; round 5 was the confirmation pass above. Hotarugari remains the strongest fallback should anything surprising surface before registration.

The sections below record rounds 1–3 for posterity.

## Why this exists

The name "Phosphene" turned out to be crowded at exactly the moment a public web presence is being planned. The domain instinct (`phosphene.app`) is taken by an active NFT art platform, `phosphene.io` is parked for sale on GoDaddy's aftermarket, `phosphene.dev` is registered by a third party (serving a WebGPU visualizer spike called "Geiss-web," which is uncomfortably close in subject matter), and — most significantly — there is **another open-source, MIT-licensed macOS app named Phosphene** ([kagerou.glass/phosphene](https://kagerou.glass/phosphene/), repo `kageroumado/phosphene`), a video-wallpaper tool actively targeting macOS 26. Same platform, same license, visually adjacent purpose. Pre-launch is the cheapest a rename will ever be, so ten candidates were vetted before committing either way.

## Method

Each candidate was checked for: existing software products and apps (weighted heavily when macOS/music/visual-adjacent), companies and trademarks, bands and music-space uses (this is a music app; music-space collisions matter more than usual), GitHub namespace, and domain availability across `.com`, `.app`, `.dev`, `.video`, and `.io`. Domain statuses marked "likely available" rest on DNS non-resolution and must be confirmed at the registrar before committing (an afternoon's task, and registration itself is the confirmation). Candidates were drawn from the same conceptual territory as "phosphene": vision-without-external-light phenomena, sound-made-visible instruments, and optics terms of art.

## Results at a glance

| Candidate | Verdict | Deciding factor |
|---|---|---|
| **Isophote** | **CLEAR** | No product, app, company, or band collisions; best domain picture of the field |
| **Clavilux** | CAUTION (mild) | Only historical/homage collisions; GitHub handle and .com taken |
| **Entoptic** | CAUTION (mild) | Active creative-tech studio at entoptic.co; word is an adjective |
| **Caustica** | CAUTION (mild) | Exact-string collisions all small; "Caustic" music app is a near-name |
| **Eigenlicht** | CAUTION | Established doom-metal band owns the name in music; spelling friction |
| **Kaleidophone** | CAUTION | Crowded by music artists and a record label; long; near Kaleidoscope.app |
| **Halation** | CAUTION | Generic term-of-art in visual software; active iOS app family + band |
| **Photism** | **BLOCKED** | photism.app is an active commercial audio-reactive music visualizer |
| **Photic** | **BLOCKED** | Exact-name App Store apps + "photic driving" is a seizure-trigger term |
| **Lumia** | **BLOCKED** | Microsoft trademark + Lumia Stream (active same-category app) + crypto brand |

For calibration, **Phosphene itself** scores roughly CAUTION on this rubric: no trademark threat (dictionary word, different spaces), but a same-platform open-source app collision, and all good domains gone.

## The three worth considering

**Isophote** — an optics/astronomy term: a contour line of equal brightness in an image. The only candidate with a fully clean sheet — no app, no product, no company, no band. `isophote.io` and `isophote.video` are confirmed available via registry RDAP; `.app` and `.dev` are likely available (unverified); only the `.com` is held, by a small legacy personal site. The word is on-theme (it is literally about the structure of light in an image), reads well, and shortens nicely ("iso"). Its weakness is obscurity — nobody knows the word, so the brand starts from zero meaning and has to earn it. That is also its strength: search results would belong to you almost immediately.

**Clavilux** — Thomas Wilfred's 1919 color organ, the founding instrument of light-as-music performance. As lineage for an AI-orchestrated visual accompanist, the story is unbeatable: Wilfred built the machine that played light; this app is that idea with a century of compute behind it. No active product, company, or band uses the name. The collisions are the historical instrument itself (arguably the point — it reads as homage, and the docs already engage seriously with Milkdrop lineage and attribution, so honoring lineage is in character for this project) and a 2010 academic project called Clavilux 2000. Costs: the GitHub username `Clavilux` is taken (an org name like `clavilux-app` or the site repo naming works around it), `clavilux.com` is registered, and people will misspell it. `.video` and `.io` confirmed available; `.app`/`.dev` likely available.

**Caustica / Entoptic** — both viable fallbacks. Caustica evokes caustics, the rendering term every shader author knows — great contributor-culture resonance — but sits one letter from "Caustic," a fairly well-known music-making app, which is an awkward adjacency for a music app specifically. Entoptic is the scientific category that *contains* phosphenes (floaters, blue-field sparks, and phosphenes are all entoptic phenomena), making it the most faithful successor conceptually, but an active creative-technology studio holds entoptic.co and builds apps, and the word is an adjective, which makes naming things after it slightly awkward ("an Entoptic preset"?).

## Round-one recommendation (superseded by the decision above)

The Latin-vocabulary round ended as a two-horse race: **Isophote** for the cleanest launch, **Clavilux** for the story. Follow-up diligence on Clavilux found `clavilux.com` held since April 2000 by an instrumental band from Olympia, WA (still renewing — through April 2027 — so not acquirable by waiting), while `clavilux.app`/`.dev`/`.video`/`.io` were all open. That band collision, missed in the first pass, softened the Clavilux case.

Matt then redirected the sprint twice: first toward original Latin-root coinages in the Clavilux mold (Sonolumen, Cantilux, Lucanto, Undalux — generated and screened, none vetted in depth), then toward the firefly/folk-art register sparked by **Luciola** (the genus that includes the Genji firefly of Japanese folklore, whose synchronized flashing over summer rivers is *hotarugari*'s object). That thread — Luciola → the viewing ritual itself — produced the winner.

Keeping Phosphene had remained defensible throughout — dictionary word, no trademark exposure — but launching while sharing a name with another open-source macOS visual app, holding none of the natural domains, made the rename the right call pre-audience.

## Rename — mechanical checklist (now live: Phosphene → Uzume)

Rename touches, in rough dependency order: **register `uzume.app` + `uzume.io` first** (before any public commits reference the name; watch/backorder `uzume.com`); GitHub repo rename to `hoaxpoet/uzume` (GitHub auto-redirects old URLs); bundle ID (`com.phosphene.app` → `app.uzume.mac` — reverse-DNS of the owned domain uzume.app; avoid `com.uzume.*`, since uzume.com is third-party) and code-signing identity; the `com.phosphene.*` logger subsystems (→ `app.uzume.*`) and the `~/Library/Application Support/Phosphene/` hot-reload path (a migration shim or a clean break is fine pre-beta); docs sweep (README, CONTRIBUTING, docs/, CLAUDE.md, prompts); `tccutil` invocations in RUNBOOK; and the projectM/Milkdrop attribution posture carries over unchanged. None of this is hard pre-launch; all of it is annoying post-launch. The name's story is also usable product vocabulary — Omoikane as the orchestrator codename, Pythagoras as the onboarding persona, the Iwato imagery (mirror, dawn, rhythm) for the brand — worth a deliberate UX-copy pass in a later increment rather than leaving the name decorative. The full RN.1 session prompt encodes the mechanical scope.

## Verification caveats

All "likely available" domain statuses are DNS-inference only. Registered/available calls for `.com` (Verisign RDAP), `.video` and `.io` (Identity Digital RDAP) are registry-grade. Before committing: confirm the chosen name's `.app`/`.dev` availability directly in the Cloudflare Registrar (or any registrar) search, and run a quick USPTO TESS search on the final candidate — none of the three finalists surfaced trademark flags in web search, but a registry search is the diligence step this report didn't perform.
